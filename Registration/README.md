# Coregistration <a name="coregistration"></a>
The first processing step in PET processing is the coregistration of the T1 image to the PET image. The co-registration algorithm is based on minctracc -- which estimates the best linear spatial transformation required to register two 3D volumes -- and proceeds hierarchically by performing iterative co-registrations at progressively finer spatial scales (Collins 1993). Two iterations of the co-registration are performed: one using binary masks of the PET brain mask and the T1 brain mask, the second iteration without any binary mask.

#### Coregistration Options

    --coreg-method=COREG_METHOD 	Coregistration method: minctracc, ants (default=minctracc)
    --coregistration-brain-mask 	Target T1 mask for coregistration (Default=True)
    --second-pass-no-mask    		Do a second pass of coregistration without masks (Default=True)
    --slice-factor=SLICE_FACTOR		Value (between 0. to 1.) that is multiplied by the 
    					maximum of the slices of the PET image. Used to
                        		threshold slices. Lower value means larger mask.
    --total-factor=TOTAL_FACTOR		Value (between 0. to 1.) that is multiplied by the
                        		thresholded means of each slice.
